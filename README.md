## Chat room with Facebook and google authorization 

The appilcation is a real-time chat app in the browser, like Google Hangouts, 
Facebook Messenger, or Slack. The User will be able to authenticate who they
are on the chat client by opening the facebook or google and login. 
The chat bot should tell the users that someone new online and there added to 
the user list. But the Bot only resopnse to the commands (!! about). Lastly 
when the user sends a message, the messages in the messages div with the 
user name and profile picture.   


## Problems


Bot also write to all the clients when someone logs in or logs out.

The google login for the user list can be buggy sometimes.

## improvements


Also the logouts to update the userlist.
