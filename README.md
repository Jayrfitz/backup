Facebook Messenger, or Slack. The User will be able to authenticate who they
are on the chat client by opening the facebook or google and login.

the user list. But the Bot only resopnse to the commands (!! about). Lastly 
when the user sends a message, the messages in the messages div with the 
user name and profile picture.
